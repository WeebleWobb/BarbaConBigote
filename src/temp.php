						<hr>
						<p>Sorry about the mix up. I am currently working on a redesign for my website. I’m not going to go out and say “New Year, New Me” but there is something  about making things better, escepcially if it’s your own portfolio. I’m working hard to provide you with the best experience possible and adding in new features that best showcase my experience, and growth in the industry.</p>
						<p>If your are interested in learning more about my experience and skillset, feel free to view my <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/bolanosjd">LinkedIn Profile</a>. <br>There you can view my work history, accolades, references, and much more. If you interested in getting in touch with me, feel free to <a href="mailto:bolanosjd@gmail.com?subject=Hola!">shoot me an e-mail</a>.</p>
						<p>Thanks for stopping by, check back soon!</p>
